I made a made a music player for my bike.

Still need to write a proper README, this is basically just notes to myself at this point.

Audio:

Disable flat volumes.

cat > /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-snd_bcm2835.conf << EOF
blacklist snd_bcm2835
EOF

FTP:

1) Install the 'rlinetd' and 'ftpd' packages.
2) Copy ftpd-wrapper to /usr/local/bin/, ensure it is executable.
3) Change the 'exec' line in /etc/rlinetd.d/ftp to run /usr/local/bin/ftpd-wrapper.
4) Remove any users listed in /etc/ftpusers who you want to be able to log in as.

Why rlinetd? Because the other inetd packages wanted to pull a lot of junk in.

rc.local:

pulseaudio -D

(
        while true
        do
                echo -e 'connect 00:23:01:04:68:2F\nquit' | bluetoothctl > /dev/null 2>&1
                sleep 5
        done
) &

/usr/local/bin/bmplayer &

And make the filesystem read-only.
